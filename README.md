 What is Message Queueing?

The use of Message Queues provides a way for parts of the application to push messages to a queue asynchronously and ensure they are delivered to the correct destination. To implement message queuing, a message broker like RabbitMQ is a good option. The message broker works as a Middleware providing temporary message storage when the receiving service is busy or disconnected.
